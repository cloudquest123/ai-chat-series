## What This Series Covers
Building a complete chat application from absolute zero to a fully working web app with persistent memory in 10 episodes.

## The Challenge
Most tutorials show you finished code but skip the actual building process. This series breaks down every single step from blank file to working application.

## The Journey
The series follows a logical progression:

1. **Terminal Script**: Simple command-line interface
2. **Interactive**: Add user input and responses
3. **Web App**: Convert to browser-based interface  
4. **Memory**: Add conversation memory

## Why This Series is Different
- **No Magic**: Every step explained
- **No Skipping**: Complete progression shown
- **Real Code**: Actual implementation, not demos
- **Real Bugs**: Show debugging process
- **Real Learning**: Build understanding, not just copying
