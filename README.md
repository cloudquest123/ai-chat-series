## What You'll Learn
Simple explanation of AI without technical jargon for complete beginners.

## Key Concepts from This Episode

### What is AI?
Think of it like having a conversation with your computer, but instead of clicking buttons, you type what you want and it understands you. Like asking your phone "What's the weather?" and it actually knows what you mean.

### Two Types of AI Applications

**Type 1: AI gives you answers** (like ChatGPT)
- You ask questions
- AI responds with information
- **This is what we're building**

**Type 2: AI does things for you** (agents/actions)  
- Booking flights
- Sending emails
- Taking actions on your behalf

### Our Project
We're building a **Type 1 AI chat application** - an AI that answers your questions and has conversations with you.

## No Code Required
This episode is pure concept explanation to build understanding before we start coding.

## Next Episode
Episode 3 shows you exactly what tools to download (Python, VS Code, OpenAI API key).

## Why This Matters
Understanding these basics makes the technical episodes much easier to follow.
